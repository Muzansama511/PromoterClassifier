# PromoterClassifier
Here we make 4 models, a markov model, 2 LSTM mdoels and a Conv model which help the users classify promoter sequences as promoter and non-promoter

The main.ipynb has the code for Markov models while NNmain.ipynb has the code for neural networks. The testing.ipynb file can be used for getting predictions for any given .fa file with a set of sequences.
Both the files make a folder named models which stores all the trained models. Note: Due to the stochastic nature of NNs the models may vary with the runs
